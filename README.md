# Predicting Website Churn Through Time Series Analysis of User Engagement Metrics

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict website user churn by leveraging time series analysis of key user engagement metrics.  The analysis identifies patterns and trends in user behavior over time to build a predictive model capable of identifying users at high risk of churning. This allows for proactive implementation of retention strategies to improve user engagement and reduce churn.  The project utilizes various time series analysis techniques to forecast future user behavior and assess the likelihood of churn.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* scikit-learn (potentially, depending on the chosen model)
* Statsmodels (potentially, depending on the chosen model)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including summary statistics of the time series data and evaluation metrics of the predictive model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  Additionally, the project will generate several visualization files (e.g., `user_engagement_trend.png`, `churn_prediction.png`) illustrating trends in user engagement and the model's predictions.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the implemented analysis and modeling techniques.


**Data:**

(Optional: Add a section describing the data used, its source, and any preprocessing steps)  For example:  "The project utilizes a dataset containing anonymized user engagement metrics, including daily logins, page views, and time spent on the website.  The data was collected over a period of [timeframe] and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers using [method]."


**Further Development:**

(Optional: Add a section outlining potential future improvements or extensions to the project) For example: "Future work could explore the use of more advanced time series models, incorporate additional user features, and develop a real-time churn prediction system."
